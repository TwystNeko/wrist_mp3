# Wrist MP3

This is a silly wrist-mounted MP3 player, using a GC901A / CST816S round LCD with touchscreen, and a Teensy 4.1 w/ Audio Board. 

It plays MP3s from SD, and supports 64 songs - which can be adjusted with the MAX_SONGS define. 

Songs must be 44.1Khz sample rate, and named as such:
```Artist-Song Name-Length in Seconds.MP3```

This can be done in Foobar, with the following settings:

I have also included STL files of my design, if you feel like printing this silly thing.
